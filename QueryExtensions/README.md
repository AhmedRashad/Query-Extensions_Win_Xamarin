# Query Extensions

Use query extensions to deal with query paramters as strongly typed properties,
 this should help reduce development time and also errors that may happen from manually constructing the query string.
The library uses attributes and reflection to generate query string.

Later I'll add an example here also a CodeGenerator which generate these classes for your from url.
